IMAGE CLASSIFICATION on Fashion MNIST with TensorFlow and TensorBoard
About the Dataset
The original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. People from AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset they would try on. “If it doesn’t work on MNIST, it won’t work at all”, they said. “Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others.” Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset to benchmark machine learning algorithms, as it shares the same image size and the structure of training and testing splits.
